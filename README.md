## Seat Collision Manager: Simplified Seat and Table Collision Toggling
Easier way to make seat and table collision toggles for your world!  
Comes with a handy marking system to easily add objects to the list of objects with a press of a button! No more dragging and dropping objects into the list!

## Getting started
1. Open your world in Unity.
2. Download and import the package. **[You can download it here!]()**
3. On **top** of your Unity Editor, navigate to _'Tools' -> 'Seat Collision Manager' -> 'Add Seat Collision Manager to Scene'_, or attach the "SeatTogglingManager" script to any GameObject.
4. You can start adding any chairs and tables to the list of objects that you want to toggle collision on and off.
5. You can also add the "Seat Marker" script to any object that you want to be a seat or a table. You can then press "Find all marked objects" to add them to the list of objects!

## Features
* **Seat and Table Control:** using included prefabs or by scripting
* **Seat Marking:** You can use the included "Seat Marker" tool to tag your seats and tables, **then click a button to add them all at once.**
* **Default Setting:** You can choose whether collisions are on or off by default for players and non-players, and the tool will handle the rest for you.

## Planned Features
