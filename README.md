## Seat Collision Manager: Simplified Seat and Table Collision Toggling
Easier way to make seat and table collision toggles for your world!  
Comes with a handy marking system to easily add objects to the list of objects with a press of a button! No more dragging and dropping objects into the list!

## Getting Started

1. **Open your world in Unity.**
2. **Download and import the package.** [**You can download it here!**]()
3. **Add the Seat Collision Manager to your scene:**
   - Navigate to `'Tools' -> 'Seat Collision Manager' -> 'Add Seat Collision Manager to Scene'` at the top of the Unity Editor.
   - Alternatively, attach the `SeatTogglingManager` script to any GameObject.
4. **Add chairs and tables to the toggle list:**
   - Start adding any chairs and tables to the list of objects that you want to toggle collision on and off.
5. **Use Seat Markers for easy setup:**
   - Add the `Seat Marker` script to any object that you want to be a seat or a table.
   - Press **"Find all marked objects"** to automatically add them to the list!

## Features

- **Seat and Table Control:** Use included prefabs or script your own.
- **Seat Marking:** Tag your seats and tables with the included `Seat Marker` tool, then click a button to add them all at once.
- **Default Settings:** Choose whether collisions are on or off by default for players and non-players; the tool will handle the rest.
- **VRCSeats and VRCStations Supported!**
